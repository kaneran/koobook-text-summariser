#Solution from https://pymotw.com/2/socket/tcp.html

#This method works by first getting the word embeddings from the GloVe text file as this process takes a while so it's better to get this step done first. It then listens on port 9878 for incoming connections.
#After connecting with a client( C# book data collector console app), it then reads all the data being sent from the client which is the description of the book.
#If continues to read from the network stream until is recieves a "#" from the client which tells the server that all the data has been received from the client.It
#then decodes the receives data into a string and uses the TextSummariser class to summarise the book description. After it receives the summarised book descrption, it then
#encodes it and sends it back to the client. After it sends it, it also sends "#" symbol to tell the client that the server has sent all the data. The server then wait until
#the client initiates the process for closing connection via a partial handshake. After closing connection, the whole process repeats.
